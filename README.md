### Development Process

This application is dependent on free APIs which have limitations. To make a minimum viable product, after analyzing the API response data we discovered that we could grab the cheapest flight possible between two locations given a fixed timeframe. (The currency API is no longer available.)

We also decided to use jQuery instead of "vanilla" JavaScript to sharpen our understanding of jQuery, as a lot of applications until more recently use this library extensively.
